# Maps of Power Website

The research initiative “Maps of Power” serves the methodological and interdisciplinary networking of scholars from the
field of Historical Geography. The initiative, which has been running since 2019 under the title “Maps of Power:
Historical Atlas of Places, Borderzones and Migration Dynamics in Byzantium (TIB Balkans)”, grew out of the idea of
deepening historical-geographical research methodologically and placing it on a broader level in terms of content.
Based on the scholarly project “Tabula Imperii Byzantini (TIB)”, which has been successfully conducted at the Austrian
Academy of Sciences (Vienna) since 1966, the initiative intends to expand the spatial focus of the TIB on the Byzantine
area in order to include other European areas in the Middle Ages as well. The successfully completed cluster project
["Digitising Patterns of Power (DPP): Peripherical Mountains in the Medieval World"](https://dpp.oeaw.ac.at/) can be
seen as a pilot project in this respect.
