        The research initiative "Maps of Power" serves the methodological and
        interdisciplinary networking of scholars from the field of Historical
        Geography. The initiative, which has been running since 2019 under the
        title "Maps of Power: Historical Atlas of Places, Borderzones and
        Migration Dynamics in Byzantium (TIB Balkans)", grew out of the idea of
        deepening historical-geographical research methodologically and placing
        it on a broader level in terms of content. Based on the scholarly
        project <a href="https://tib.oeaw.ac.at" class="link-primary" target="_blank">"Tabula Imperii Byzantini
        (TIB)"</a>, which has been successfully
        conducted at the Austrian Academy of Sciences (Vienna) since 1966, the
        initiative intends to expand the spatial focus of the TIB on the
        Byzantine area in order to include other European areas in the Middle
        Ages as well. The successfully completed cluster project
        <a href="https://dpp.oeaw.ac.at/" class="link-primary" target="_blank">"Digitising
          Patterns of Power (DPP): Peripherical Mountains in the Medieval World"</a>
        can be seen as a pilot project in this
        respect.
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5">
        {{ _('about_text_2') }}
        In order to do justice to this new idea of spatial expansion, the
        previous title of the research initiative will be renamed "Maps of
        Power â€“ Karten der Macht", which will allow for larger thematic depth
        and a longer temporal breadth. The research perspectives of the TIB until now as a representative of
        the research branch Historical Geography of the Byzantine Empire
        essentially dealt with four categories of historical sources:
      </p>
      <div class="categories row">
        {{ category_images }}
      </div>
      <p class="fs-5">
           {{ _('about_text_3') }}
        The paradigm shifts in content and technical-digital innovations in science with the corresponding
        methodological expansions in the second half of the 20th century and in the 21st century require a
        methodological rethink. For the initiative, this means increased cooperation of Historical Geography with
        Byzantine Studies in the broader sense, as well as with Medieval Studies and the Digital Humanities.

      <p class="fs-5">
           {{ _('about_text_4') }}
        Therefore, the research initiative "Maps of Power" takes up two research areas that have the potential to act as
        a link between Byzantine and more Western European oriented Historical Geography and thereby lead to new
        research results that are significant for society:
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5">
           {{ _('about_point_1') }}
        1) Historical Ecology, which deals with the historical development of ecosystems and landscapes under the
        influence of natural and anthropogenic factors.
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5">
           {{ _('about_point_2') }}
        2) Sacred Topography ("Sacred Landscapes"), which reflects the presence of the divine/sacred/transcendent in a
        given area and manifests itself through religious buildings (e.g. churches and monasteries) and religious
        symbols and actions (e.g. pilgrimage).
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5">
           {{ _('about_text_5') }}
        The aim of Historical Ecology is to focus more on the relationship between nature and humans, or humans and
        nature, and the transformation of landscape through human intervention. In this context, the term "power" is to
        be understood as "power" or "control" over someone or something. For thousands of years, human civilisation has
        influenced vegetation in Europe (by clearing and planting fields, introducing cultivated plants, etc.). At the
        same time, nature significantly determined the geography of settlements, for example through watercourses, until
        the era of excessive regulations. Thus, the term "power" is applicable in both directions (nature and man).
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5">
           {{ _('about_text_6') }}
        The object of study of the Sacred Topography of Byzantine landscapes are to a large extent urban and rural
        churches, on the basis of whose distribution one can explore sacred space, ritual and religious identities. In
        addition, it will be investigated whether certain landscape features favoured the formation of certain types of
        cults and the formation of places of worship. The perception of space by people in the Middle Ages plays an
        important role in this very respect. GIS software, digital cartography and database systems are increasingly used in both research areas.
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5">
           {{ _('about_text_7') }}
        "Maps of Power" takes up these ideas and sees itself as a scholarly platform that would like to implement its
        own projects as well as network in an interdisciplinary fashion through joint projects. Research results of the
        initiative are made freely available in a specially programmed portal that makes data searchable, contains
        digital maps (layers), offers storymaps on various aspects and includes comprehensive photo material.
