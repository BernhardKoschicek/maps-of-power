"the research initiative “Maps of Power\" serves the methodological and "
"interdisciplinary networking of scholars from the field of Historical Geography. "
"The initiative, which has been running since 2019 under the title “Maps of "
"Power: Historical Atlas of Places, Borderzones and Migration Dynamics in "
"Byzantium (TIB Balkans)”, grew out of the idea of deepening historical-"
"geographical research methodologically and placing it on a broader level in "
"terms of content. Based on the scholarly project <a href=\"https://tib.oeaw.ac."
"at\" class=\"link-primary\" target=\"_blank\">“Tabula Imperii Byzantini (TIB)”</"
"a>, which has been successfully conducted at the Austrian Academy of Sciences "
"(Vienna) since 1966, the initiative intends to expand the spatial focus of the "
"TIB on the Byzantine area in order to include other European areas in the Middle "
"Ages as well. The successfully completed cluster project <a href=\"https://dpp."
"oeaw.ac.at/\" class=\"link-primary\" target=\"_blank\">“Digitising Patterns of "
"Power (DPP): Peripherical Mountains in the Medieval World”</a> can be seen as a "
"pilot project in this respect."

msgstr ""
"in order to do justice to this new idea of spatial expansion, the previous title "
"of the research initiative will be renamed “Maps of Power – Karten der Macht”, "
"which will allow for larger thematic depth and a longer temporal breadth. The "
"research perspectives of the TIB until now as a representative of the research "
"branch Historical Geography of the Byzantine Empire essentially dealt with four "
"categories of historical sources:"

msgid "about_text_3"
msgstr ""
"the paradigm shifts in content and technical-digital innovations in science with "
"the corresponding methodological expansions in the second half of the 20th "
"century and in the 21st century require a methodological rethink. For the "
"initiative, this means increased cooperation of Historical Geography with "
"Byzantine Studies in the broader sense, as well as with Medieval Studies and the "
"Digital Humanities."

"therefore, the research initiative “Maps of Power” takes up two research areas "

"European oriented Historical Geography and thereby lead to new research results "

"the aim of Historical Ecology is to focus more on the relationship between "
"nature and humans, or humans and nature, and the transformation of landscape "
"through human intervention. In this context, the term “power” is to be "
"understood as “power” or “control” over someone or something. For thousands of "
"years, human civilisation has influenced vegetation in Europe (by clearing and "
"planting fields, introducing cultivated plants, etc.). At the same time, nature "
"significantly determined the geography of settlements, for example through "
"watercourses, until the era of excessive regulations. Thus, the term “power” is "
"applicable in both directions (nature and man)."

"the object of study of the Sacred Topography of Byzantine landscapes are to a "
"large extent urban and rural churches, on the basis of whose distribution one "
"can explore sacred space, ritual and religious identities. In addition, it will "
"be investigated whether certain landscape features favoured the formation of "
"certain types of cults and the formation of places of worship. The perception of "
"space by people in the Middle Ages plays an important role in this very respect. "
"GIS software, digital cartography and database systems are increasingly used in "
"both research areas."
