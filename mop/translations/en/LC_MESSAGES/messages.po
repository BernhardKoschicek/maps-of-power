"archaeology and history deal naturally with the time-space challenge. Despite "
"numerous advances in the field of spatial analysis and landscape studies derived "
"from the quantitative revolution that took place in the 70’s of the past "
"century, a real “spatial turn” in archaeology is sometimes still overlooked. As "
"pointed out by Edward Soja in one of his most influential works: “[the spatial "
"turn] cannot be accomplished simply by appending spatial highlights to inherited "
"critical perspectives and sitting back to watch them glow with logical "
"conviction”. A problem that stands in the way of the production of -true- "
"spatial narratives in archaeology is related to three main issues: first, the "
"treatment of time and temporal scales in archaeology; second, a sometimes-"
"unconscious oblivion to the fact that social space is not equal to natural "
"-Euclidean- space, and third that scale is, when dealing with the time-space "
"conundrum, a fundamental piece in the machinery of unfolding events. The "
"implicit assumption that the data we work with, collected by us or by other "
"colleagues, as well as the methodology we use, do not present biases and are not "
"subjected to a (conscious or unconscious) pre-selection, hindrances as well some "

"In this lecture, I will present the current state of my PhD research, which "
"deals with the social organization, economic structures and political networks "
"of pastoral communities in the Southern Balkans (Macedonia, Epirus and Thessaly) "
"from the Middle Byzantine to the Early Ottoman period (10th-15th century). This "
"paper will focus on the first results and the methodological questions they "
"raise for the history and historical geography of the Balkans. The first set of "
"challenges concerns the elaboration of relevant analytical categories. Premodern "
"pastoral communities were mostly oral societies, geographically and symbolically "
"peripheral to the monastic, urban and political centers where the literate "
"elites produced the bulk of surviving sources. How then to define and identify "
"them without reusing at face-value the categories produced by outsiders? "
"Furthermore, these categories – some with a continuous record of use to the "
"present – have historically oscillated between serving as economic and/or ethnic "
"labels. Hence, I will explore ways to avoid a nominal essentialism projecting "
"contemporary ethnonational meanings onto the past without dissolving the "
"coherence of these collectives. The second set of challenges revolves around "
"reconstructing and mapping the spatialities of groups whose mobility was an "
"essential characteristic. Considering the importance of their geographical "
"context, I will present the issues raised by the paucity and uneven distribution "
"of place-specific sources, and discuss to what extent GIS tools can help or "
"hinder our understanding of their spatial practices and representations."
