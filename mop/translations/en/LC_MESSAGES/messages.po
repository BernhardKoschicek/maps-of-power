"numerous villages, powerful monastic foundations, and smaller hermitages "

"archaeology and history deal naturally with the time-space challenge. Despite "
"numerous advances in the field of spatial analysis and landscape studies derived "
"from the quantitative revolution that took place in the 70’s of the past "
"century, a real “spatial turn” in archaeology is sometimes still overlooked. As "
"pointed out by Edward Soja in one of his most influential works: “[the spatial "

"spatial narratives in archaeology is related to three main issues: first, the "

"unconscious oblivion to the fact that social space is not equal to natural -"
"Euclidean- space, and third that scale is, when dealing with the time-space "
"conundrum, a fundamental piece in the machinery of unfolding events. The "
"implicit assumption that the data we work with, collected by us or by other "
