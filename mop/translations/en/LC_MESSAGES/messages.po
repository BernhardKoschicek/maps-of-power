"the landscape of the Southeast Peloponnese (Laconia, Greece), a very important "

"of important bishopric centers, such as Mistra and Monemvasia, as well as "
"numerous villages, powerful monastic foundations, and smaller hermitages "
"frequently built in caves and isolated settings. Grounded both on systematic "
"fieldwork and detailed surveys of the monuments, this book is the first "
"comprehensive study of the eremitical and monastic landscapes of the region. It "
"investigates the interactions of isolated hermits and established communities, "
"the relationships of large monasteries to smaller foundations, and the "
"interweaving of monastic and rural economies. It aims at identifying the monks "
"themselves, their preoccupations and aspirations, which are reflected not only "
"by the choice of the patron saints of the holy places they founded or the "
"content of the painted decoration but also by the choice of location or a deep "

"archaeology and history deal naturally with the time-space challenge. Despite "
"numerous advances in the field of spatial analysis and landscape studies derived "
"from the quantitative revolution that took place in the 70’s of the past "
"century, a real “spatial turn” in archaeology is sometimes still overlooked. As "
"pointed out by Edward Soja in one of his most influential works: “[the spatial "
"turn] cannot be accomplished simply by appending spatial highlights to inherited "
"critical perspectives and sitting back to watch them glow with logical "
"conviction”. A problem that stands in the way of the production of -true- "
"spatial narratives in archaeology is related to three main issues: first, the "
"treatment of time and temporal scales in archaeology; second, a sometimes-"
"unconscious oblivion to the fact that social space is not equal to natural -"
"Euclidean- space, and third that scale is, when dealing with the time-space "
"conundrum, a fundamental piece in the machinery of unfolding events. The "
"implicit assumption that the data we work with, collected by us or by other "
"colleagues, as well as the methodology we use, do not present biases and are not "
