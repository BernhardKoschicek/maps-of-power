"numerous villages, powerful monastic foundations, and smaller hermitages "

"investigates the interactions of isolated hermits and established communities, "
"the relationships of large monasteries to smaller foundations, and the "
"interweaving of monastic and rural economies. It aims at identifying the monks "

"archaeology and history deal naturally with the time-space challenge. Despite "
"numerous advances in the field of spatial analysis and landscape studies derived "
"from the quantitative revolution that took place in the 70’s of the past "
"century, a real “spatial turn” in archaeology is sometimes still overlooked. As "
"pointed out by Edward Soja in one of his most influential works: “[the spatial "

"critical perspectives and sitting back to watch them glow with logical "
"conviction”. A problem that stands in the way of the production of -true- "
"spatial narratives in archaeology is related to three main issues: first, the "

"unconscious oblivion to the fact that social space is not equal to natural -"
"Euclidean- space, and third that scale is, when dealing with the time-space "
"conundrum, a fundamental piece in the machinery of unfolding events. The "
"implicit assumption that the data we work with, collected by us or by other "
"colleagues, as well as the methodology we use, do not present biases and are not "

"the object of study of the Sacred Topography of Byzantine landscapes are to a "
"large extent urban and rural churches, on the basis of whose distribution one "
"can explore sacred space, ritual and religious identities. In addition, it will "
"be investigated whether certain landscape features favoured the formation of "
"certain types of cults and the formation of places of worship. The perception of "
"space by people in the Middle Ages plays an important role in this very respect. "
"GIS software, digital cartography and database systems are increasingly used in "
"both research areas."
